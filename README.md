# ADMIXBoots
## Nextflow Bootstrapped ADMIXTURE workflow

## Introduction
*ADMIXBoots* is a nextflow implementation of a bootstrapped admixture pipeline. 

## Dependencies
### Nextflow
Nextflow needs to be installed and in your path to be able to run the pipeline (see [here](https://www.nextflow.io/)). The workflow comes with a docker container as well as an anaconda environment that can be used to run all the dependencies (see below).
We provide few custom configurations for HPC systems, so these might need to be changed and expanded depending on the need.

### Profiles
*ADMIXBoots* comes with a series of pre-defined profiles:
 - standard: this profile runs all dependencies in docker and other basic presets to facilitate the use
 - local: runs using local exe instead of containerized/conda dependencies (see manual installation for further details)
 - docker: use docker to run the workflow 
 - singularity: use singularity to run the container
 - conda: runs the dependencies within anaconda
 - uge: runs using UGE scheduling system
 - sge: runs using SGE scheduling system
A docker image is available with all the dependencies at tale88/nf-roh. This docker ships all necessary dependencies to run nf-roh. 
This is the recommended mode of usage of the software, since all the dependencies come shipped in the container.

### Manual installation
In the case the system doesn't support docker/singularity, it is possible to download them all through the script install.sh.
This script will download a series of software and save them in the ./bin folder, including:
 1. [plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink) with packages:
 2. [admixture](https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/download.html)
 3. [clumpp](https://rosenberglab.stanford.edu/clumpp.html)
 4. [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    1. numpy
    2. pandas
 5. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with packages:
    1. ggplot2
    2. tidyverse
    3. reshape2
    4. forcats
    5. ggthemes
    6. patchwork

Remember to add the ```bin``` folder to your path with the command:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/bin
```
Or link te folder to the working directory:
```
ln -s /PATH/TO/bin
```

Ready to go!


## Running the pipeline
Note: I am currently working on the test dataset for the analysis.
To test the pipeline locally, simply run:
```
nextflow run RenzoTale88/ADMIXBoots 
    -profile test,docker
```
This will download and run the pipeline on the two toy genomes provided and generate liftover files. If you have all dependencies installed locally you can omit ```docker``` from the profile configuration.
To see all the parameters, you can run the command:
```
nextflow run RenzoTale88/ADMIXBoots --help
```
